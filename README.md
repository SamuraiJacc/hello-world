Hello folks, 

I'm Jacc, I'm new to coding. I love music and have been a musician since the age of 4.
I was a drummer in elementary school band and highschool drumline ( wasn't a legit drumline lol )
Now, I make music on a music software/program on FL.
But, music isn't always a promising career path so, now I want to learn more about coding.
